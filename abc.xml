          Xylocaine was given. A small conjunctival peritomy was made in the
          area of the subconjunctival injection. Three cc of 2% Xylocaine and
          0.75% Marcaine were injected into the sub-Tenon's space through the
          peritomy.

          A paracentesis was
          performed superiorly and inferiorly. Intraocular nonpreserved
          Xylocaine was used. A viscoelastic was injected into the anterior
          chamber. The eye was entered with a 3 mm keratome. The anterior
          capsulectomy was done under a viscoelastic. Hydrodissection and
          delineation of the nucleus was carried out. The
          phaco-emulsification was initiated. The phacoemulsification time
          was

          completion of the phacoemulsification, the cortical material was
          irrigated and aspirated from the eye. The posterior capsule was
          polished. The intraocular lens was inserted under a viscoelastic.
          The intraocular lens power was __ diopters.

          At the completion of
          the vitrectomy, the peripheral retina was reinspected to ensure
          there was no untreated peripheral retinal tears or detachment. The
          cannulas were removed. The scleral wounds inspected and if a wound
          leak was identified, then this was closed with 9-0 Vicryl suture.
          Otherwise interrupted 9-0 Vicryl sutures were placed.
          Subconjunctival Decadron and cefuroxime were given.
